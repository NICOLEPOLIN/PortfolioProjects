SQL projects:
Project Purpose
Welcome to my first data analytics project! The primary objective of this endeavor is to practice data analysis using SQL
and showcase my skills in managing and querying databases. This project marks a significant milestone in my journey of exploring the world of data analytics.
During one of the courses at the university (10645), I was introduced to the fundamentals of SQL,
and it sparked my interest in the field of data management and analysis. Determined to enhance my skills in this area, I took the initiative to continue learning independently.

This repository contains a  COVID-19 dataset stored in SQL format. I did this project to help me  practice my SQL skills
The COVID-19 dataset i used is  from : "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths".
